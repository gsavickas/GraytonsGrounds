        <p class="text-white">You are in a dark windowless room as an active duty military member
           and you a learning your classified trade craft. If you were like me you spent extra time on learning all
            you could to pass your technical exams. How are you going to stay awake in that cold dark space? Caffeine. 
            Energy drinks have caffeine but too much sugar you need to pass your fitness tests. Coffee? The communal coffee pot 
            always has something in it but it tastes more like dirty water more than anything.
             So after you doctor it up with sugar and creamer. 
            Still itâ€™s not much better for you. The solution? Brew better coffee.
           Coffee made right, from the roast to the grounds to your cup. </p>
